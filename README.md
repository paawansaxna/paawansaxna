# Welcome - It's Paawan Saxena

Computer Science Engineering student at **Jabalpur Engineering College (JEC)**.  
Frontend-focused developer with a strong interest in UI/UX, 3D web experiences, and interactive animations.

I enjoy building clean, user-centric interfaces and experimenting with modern web technologies. I actively participate in hackathons and team-based projects, where I focus on converting ideas into functional and visually appealing products.

Always learning, always building.
